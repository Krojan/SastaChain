## INRODUCTION
**Blockchain 101** (aka **SastaCoin**) is a basic application developed using blockchain principles.

*You can create a new chain, mine a block, add transactions to block, connect nodes to the network and synchronize the nodes with the network. Similar to blockchain, the longest chain is applied if two nodes simultaneously mine a block.*


##  INSTALLATION
1. Install Docker
2. Build an image and run the container
	`docker-compose up --build`
